Privacy Policy for Auto_post

Effective Date: January 02, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how Auto_post ("we", "the Tool", or "the App") operates when managing a personal Facebook Page using the Meta (Facebook) Graph API. Auto_post is a personal automation tool built for posting content, moderating comments, and managing messages on my own Facebook Page through n8n or similar platforms. It does not collect, store, or process personal data outside of Facebook's ecosystem.
The Tool uses authorized Meta Graph API permissions, including but not limited to:

pages_manage_posts
pages_read_engagement
pages_manage_engagement
pages_messaging

1. Information We Access
Auto_post accesses the following data solely through the Facebook Graph API (all data remains on Meta's servers and is governed by Meta's Privacy Policy):

Posts on the managed Facebook Page (public or private).
Comments on Page posts (to reply, moderate, or remove spam).
Messages sent to the Page’s inbox (to reply or initiate messages to users who interact with the Page).
User interactions (e.g., comments, likes) to identify and remove spam or block users who spam repeatedly (more than 2 times).

Important: Auto_post does not collect, store, or process any personal data (e.g., names, user IDs, comments, or messages) outside of Facebook. All actions (autoposting, comment replies, message replies, messaging new audiences, spam comment removal, and user blocking) occur directly via the Graph API within Facebook’s platform. Only when the customer wants to order any products, we only collect Full name, Address, and Phone Numbers for smooth delivery.

2. How We Use Accessed Information
The accessed information is used only for the following purposes:

Automatically posting content to the Facebook Page.
Replying to comments on Page posts.
Responding to messages in the Page inbox and sending messages to users who have interacted with the Page.
Moderating content by removing spam comments and blocking users who post spam more than 2 times.
Engaging with new audiences who interact with the Page (e.g., sending welcome messages).

All actions are automated and temporary. No data is retained after the action is completed.

3. Data Sharing and Disclosure
Auto_post does not share any data with third parties. All data handling occurs exclusively within Meta’s platforms and is subject to Meta’s Privacy Policy (available at: https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy).
We do not sell, trade, or transfer any information.

4. Data Storage and Security
Auto_post does not store any data locally or on third-party servers. Security is ensured through secure OAuth access tokens provided by Meta, which are limited to the necessary permissions.

5. No Collection of Personal Information
Auto_post does not collect personal information directly from users. All interactions occur on Facebook, where users are subject to Meta’s terms and privacy controls.

6. User Data Deletion
Auto_post does not store user data. If you believe any data needs to be addressed, please contact Meta directly, as all data resides on their platform.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy as needed. The updated version will be indicated by the "Effective Date" above.
